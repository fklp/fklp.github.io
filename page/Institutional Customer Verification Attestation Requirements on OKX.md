## Key Attestation Requirements for Institutional Customers  

The verification process for institutional customers involves legally binding commitments regarding compliance, documentation accuracy, and jurisdictional restrictions. These attestation requirements are designed to protect both OKX and its clients while maintaining adherence to international financial regulations.  

### A. Agreement to Terms of Service  
Applicants must explicitly confirm acceptance of OKXâ€™s **Terms of Service**, including future modifications. This ensures all users operate under the same legal framework governing platform usage, dispute resolution, and service conditions.  

### B. Accuracy of Application Documentation  
All information submitted during the verification process must be:  
- **True**  
- **Accurate**  
- **Complete**  

This includes corporate registration documents, ownership structures, and financial records. False or incomplete submissions may lead to account suspension or legal consequences.  

### C. Ongoing Documentation Integrity  
Applicants must maintain the accuracy of their documentation throughout their relationship with OKX. This includes promptly updating:  
- Changes in ownership  
- New business licenses  
- Updated compliance certifications  

### D. Jurisdictional Restrictions  
Institutional customers cannot be:  
- Registered or established in the **United States**  
- Operated from jurisdictions subject to international sanctions (e.g., **Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk**)  

This aligns with OKXâ€™s commitment to avoiding high-risk regions where financial activities might violate regulatory frameworks like FATF guidelines.  

### E. Principal Place of Business Criteria  
Applicants must ensure their **primary operational headquarters**â€”where trading strategies and management decisions originateâ€”is located outside restricted jurisdictions. This prevents circumvention of compliance measures through shell entities.  

### F. Prohibition on U.S.-Goverened Trusts  
Entities structured as trusts under U.S. law, or those subject to U.S. court oversight, are ineligible for institutional verification on OKX. This restriction mitigates exposure to conflicting legal obligations.  

### G. Account Usage Compliance  
Institutional accounts must not be used to:  
1. Service individuals/entities in sanctioned jurisdictions  
2. Allow access to parties listed on global sanctions databases  
3. Facilitate transactions violating OKXâ€™s **Prohibited Activities Policy**  

This requirement prevents the platform from inadvertently enabling non-compliant financial activities.  

### H. Due Diligence Obligations  
Applicants must conduct continuous due diligence on:  
- Counterparty legitimacy  
- Transaction monitoring  
- Regulatory reporting requirements  

This ensures institutional clients maintain compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) standards.

## Strategic Importance of Attestation Compliance  

### Mitigating Regulatory Risks  
By requiring institutional clients to attest compliance, OKX reduces exposure to:  
| Risk Category        | Potential Impact                |  
|----------------------|----------------------------------|  
| AML violations       | Fines up to $5M+                 |  
| Sanctions breaches   | Criminal liability for executives |  
| Data inaccuracies    | Operational disruptions          |  

### Enhancing Platform Security  
Accurate attestation prevents malicious actors from exploiting institutional accounts for illicit activities. For example, a 2023 case demonstrated how falsified documentation allowed a shell company to launder $12M through cryptocurrency exchanges before detection.  

### Supporting Institutional Client Success  
Clear compliance frameworks enable institutional clients to:  
- Operate transparently across borders  
- Access advanced trading features (e.g., margin trading, OTC desks)
