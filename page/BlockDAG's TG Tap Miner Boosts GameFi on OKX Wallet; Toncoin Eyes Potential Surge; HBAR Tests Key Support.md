## Toncoin (TON): Signs of a Potential Rally

The **Toncoin blockchain**, originally developed by Telegram, has shown technical indicators suggesting a possible price surge. Recent market signals include:  
- **Open Interest Delta (OID)**: A rising OID in TON futures suggests increased institutional interest.

| RSI (Relative Strength Index) | 42 (Oversold territory) |
| Network Transactions  | 1.2M daily (â†‘15% QoQ)  |

If HBAR holds above $0.085, it could rebound to $0.11 by Q2 2025. However, a breakdown below this level may trigger panic selling, pushing prices toward $0.06.
